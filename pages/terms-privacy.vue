            The Member is required to cancel the Subscription on their dashboard
            for the cancellation to be effective. Failure to cancel a
            Subscription within 48 hours after payment operates as a total
            waiver of the right to a full refund. Cancellation of a Subscription
            due to withdrawal of a Listing by the Host entitles the Member to a
            full refund of all sums paid by the Member at the Host’s expense and
            liability.
            <br /><br />

            There shall be no partial or full refund of the amount paid by the
            Member in any when the Subscription is active, which is 48 hours
            after the payment has been confirmed.

            <br /><br />

            If any sum owed under this Agreement is not paid or if a Member
            breaches any of the Terms stated herein, or where the Provider, in
            its sole discretion believes or has any reason to believe that the
            Member will be a menace, damage property, constitute a nuisance, act
            recklessly or in such a manner that is improper or considered
            unacceptable by the Provider (hereinafter referred to as "Breach of
            Terms"), the Provider may give the Member a notice of the Breach of
            Terms orally or in writing. Where the Member fails to cure same
            after two (2) business days from the date of delivery of the notice,
            the Provider shall deliver a five (5) day notice to terminate the
            Subscription and re-enter the Accommodation.

            <br /><br />

            You hereby expressly agree that it shall be lawful for the Provider
            at any time thereafter to re-enter the Accommodation or any part
            thereof without recourse to a court of law. Upon the Provider’s
            re-entry into the Accommodation, the Subscription will be forthwith
            terminated.

            <br /><br />

            In the case of Breach of Terms, the Provider has the right to shut
            down power, water and change the locks to the Accommodation.

            <br /><br />
